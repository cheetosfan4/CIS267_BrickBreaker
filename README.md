# BRICKSHOT | CIS267 HW02 | Marc McLennan

## GUIDE
### GOAL
Your goal is to break all the bricks in the current level. Losing all three of your lives will result in a game over. Losing a life is caused by either losing your main ball, or getting hit by the shot effect.

### CONTROLS
Move your mouse horizontally to control the bar, and click to shoot your ball upwards. If you have the extra balls effect, clicking will shoot each ball one by one, starting from the left. If you have the extra balls effect and your main ball, the main ball will take priority. 

Press P to pause or unpause the game.

### EFFECTS
Duplicate balls: Spawns a ghost ball at the position of each ball on your screen.

Extra balls: Grants you three ghost balls on your bar that you can shoot one at a time.

Shot: Shoots a flaming ball straight downwards. This will cause you to lose a life if it touches your bar.
